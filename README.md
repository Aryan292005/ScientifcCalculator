# ScientifcCalculator
# 🧮 Scientific Calculator - Java Swing GUI
A feature-rich scientific calculator built using **Java Swing**, designed with a clean **light theme**, a fully functional **GUI**, and **history tracking**. Ideal for students, developers, or anyone looking for a reliable calculator application.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- 🧠 Advanced functions: 
  - `sin`, `cos`, `tan` (degree-based)
  - `sqrt` (square root)
  - `log` (base-10 logarithm)
  - `pow` (exponentiation via `^`)
- 📝 Expression evaluation: Supports complex expressions like `3 + 4 * 2 / (1 - 5)^2`
- 📜 History view: Automatically tracks and displays past calculations
- 🎨 Light theme for a clean and modern look
- 🚪 CLR and EXIT buttons for clearing input and exiting the app
